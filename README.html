<h2>Bootcamp Module Challenge Assignment</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Code Refactoring of an Example Business Website That Can Benefit from Some Enhancements</p>
<br/>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This assignment -- which was for the Module Challenge of the DU Coding Bootcamp -- was done for the purpose of furthering the starting introductory/basic HTML and CSS concepts and commands that are a good foundation to the full-stack (front-end and back-end) development of webpage systems. This assignment was an logical extension of the "Prework Study Guide" tool assignment that was done for an initiation for the 1st bootcamp class; Refer to below for additional information (and links) about the "Prework Study Guide" assignment.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<br/>
<p>To use this webpage...<br/>
<br/>
1. Click the menu/section links to test about their functionality; <br/>
2. Point to the pictures and graphic icons and the tab title of the webpage (and pause for a moment at each pointing) to view HTML alt/alternate text that describes the pictures/icons to users of the webpage during situations when the pictures/icons cannot be displayed;<br/>
3. Attempt to resize the browser window to change the display size of the webpage to test about the versatility of the layout content of the webpage where the layout should change to a different view that does not interfere with readability.<br/>
<br/>
The following picture shows the appearance of the upgraded refactored webpage:<br/>
